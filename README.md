# Machine Learning PCA and LDA Exploratory Analysis Of Financial Data
This repo decides which features are helpful in predicting the target variable for time series data –serial correlation, momentum, technical analysis indicators (such as RSI), and signals from trend-following strategies (such as the moving average crossover). This has been referenced from De Prado's book on Machine Learning for Finance.

Further it includes - 

1.	Selecting at least four explanatory variables and perform the necessary transformations so that they are useful in the model phase. 

2.	Details about each technique investigated and a step by step implementation of it in a Jupyter Notebook.
